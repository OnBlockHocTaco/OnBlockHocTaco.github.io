            <p> Hi there, I'm a 4th year studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. My academic passions 
                include all things Computer Science. I have delved into Blockchain Development 
                through the startup I co-founded in Highschool using the decentralized
                nature of the Blockchain to store clinical trial information. I recently garnered Cybersecurity and 
                Vulnerability Testing experience through my most recent internship with Appsoc.
                
                I have a particular forte with Machine Learning through the numerous internships I 
                have completed with focuses on Computer Vision and Large Language Models, the numerous classes
                I have taken covering the math and design of neural networks, a multitude of personal projects 
                such as Reinforcement Learning based opponents in my favorite board game, and finally the research
                I am conducting on In-Context Learning alongside Professor Anant Sahai.
            </p>

            <p> When I am not putting off studying for class, I am busy with numerous extracurriculars
                such as Cal Hacks where I am an organizer for America's largest Collegiate Hackathon for 
                over 8000 participants, or as a Consultant for 180 Degrees Consulting, Berkeley, part of the world's largest 
                student consultancy completing projects for non-profits and social enterprises such as
                the United Nations or the Environmental Defense Fund, and as a Project Manager for Datastory where I head teams
                of data scientists to implement predictive language models for Fortune 500 banks.
            </p>

            <p> I sometimes do things for fun. I am currently learning how to do card magic, by the way 
                shoutout to the Penn and Teller Masterclass, and I am on the quest to visit all National Parks, 
                currently at 14 out of 63. 
            </p>

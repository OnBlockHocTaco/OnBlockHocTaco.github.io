            <p> My academic passions include all things Computer Science from Blockchain 
                Development in the startup I co-founded in High School, to cybersecurity through
                my most recent internship with Appsoc. 
                
                I have a particular forte with Machine Learning through the numerous internships I 
                have completed with focuses on Computer Vision and Large Language Models, the classes
                I have taken covering the math and design of neural networks, and finally the research
                I am completing into In-Context Learning alongside Professor Anant Sahai
            </p>

            <p> When I am not putting off studying for class, I am busy with numerous extracurriculars
                such as Cal Hacks where I have helped put on America's largest Collegiate Hackathon for 
                over 8000 participants, or 180 Degrees Consulting Berkeley, part of the world's largest 
                student consultancy completing projects for non-profits and social enterprises such as
                the United Nations or the Environmental Defense Fund, and Datastory where I head teams
                of data scientists to implement predicitive language models for Fortune 500 banks.
            </p>

            <p> I sometimes do things for fun. I am currently learning how to do card magic, by the way 
                shoutout to the Penn and Teller's Masterclass, and I am on the quest to visit all National Parks, 
                currently at 15 out of 63.

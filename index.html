            <p> 
                Hi there, I'm Avi. 
                I'm a SF Based Software Engineer at Deloitte working with AI and DevOps Enablement.
                I studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley and am passionate about ALL things CS. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a particular forte with Machine Learning through my numerous internships at Quantiphi, Pointguard, and Realm Labs 
                building out Computer Vision and LLM Systems for Cybersecurity and AI Governance. At Berkeley I conducted 
                research under Professor Anant Sahai into In-Context Learning Prmpting and Alignment not to mention
                taking multiple classes into the math and inner workings of neural networks. Much of my experience has 
                come from personal projects such as building Reinforcement Learning-based opponents in my favorite board 
                game Quoridor or designing AI Agents for communication.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of ML, past experiences include working with large distrubuted database systems, overseeing DevSecOps 
                integrations, and designing blockchain systems to store Clinical Trial Information. Outside of work, I organized Cal Hacks, 
                America's largest Collegiate Hackathon for over 12000 participants, serverd as a Executive for 
                180 Degrees Consulting, Berkeley serving non-profits and social enterprises like the United Nations or Environmental Defense Fund
                and was a Project Manager for Datastory where I headed team of data scientists to implement predictive language models
                for Fortune 500 banks. These experiences gave me a complete toolkit of technical and analytical skills while making real world impacts.
            </p>

                When I am not putting off studying for class, I am busy with numerous extracurriculars
                such as Cal Hacks where I am an organizer for America's largest Collegiate Hackathon for 
                over 8000 participants, or as a Consultant for 180 Degrees Consulting, Berkeley, part of the world's largest 
                student consultancy completing projects for non-profits and social enterprises such as
                the United Nations or the Environmental Defense Fund, and as a Project Manager for Datastory where I head teams
                of data scientists to implement predictive language models for Fortune 500 banks.

            <p> I sometimes do things for fun. I am currently learning how to do card magic, play the guitar, and am on the 
                quest to visit all National Parks: currently at 16 out of 63.
